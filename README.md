# Semiconductor-Production-Line-Downtime-Analysis-Using-Markov-Models-and-Q-Learning
##Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing semiconductor equipment maintenance decisions to reduce downtime, maximize production yield, and minimize operational costs.
We model the system using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solve it using Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm.
To validate model robustness, we use extensive Monte Carlo simulations across 10,000+ production scenarios.

#Objectives

*Model equipment degradation and transitions between operational states.

*Optimize maintenance strategies (Continue, Inspect, Repair, Scrap) using Q-Learning.

*Minimize early failures, maintenance costs, and maximize reward and reliability.

*Validate results using Monte Carlo simulation.

*Visualize distributions for reliability analysis (MTBF, MTBR, Rewards, Costs).
